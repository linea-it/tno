            The straight and continue lines are the shadow limits considering
            the estimated radius; when the shadow crosses the Earth's surface,

            Each blue dot is spaced by one minute and the big blue dot
            corresponds to the nominal occultation time (which is the geocentric
            closest approach);

            Areas in dark grey correspond to full night (Sun elevation below -18
            degrees) and areas in light grey correspond to twilight (Sun

            Time, the night of the event may begin at the date before.
