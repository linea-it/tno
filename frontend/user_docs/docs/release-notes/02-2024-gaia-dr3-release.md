# Gaia DR3 Update

Release date: April 21st, 2024.

Main updates include the use of Gaia DR3 star catalogue and new filter options such as magnitude drop, event duration, and object size.

At this stage occultation predictions are computed only for the outer Solar System objects including those classified as **Trojans**, **Centaurs**, and **Kuiper Belt**.

The total number of predictions also include a small percentage of events that happen strictly during the day, which are in very special cases of interest to some astronomers.

Below are the description of the main input sources and the outputs produced in this release.
