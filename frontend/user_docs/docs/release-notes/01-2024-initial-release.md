# Initial Release

Release date: April 2nd, 2024.

**Please be advised this is our initial _beta release_**. Not all asteroid classes are included. At this stage occultation predictions are computed only for the outer Solar System objects including those classified as **Trojans**, **Centaurs**, **Kuiper Belt**, and **Inner Oort Cloud**.

The total number of predictions also include a small percentage of events that happen strictly during the day, which are in very special cases of interest to some astronomers.

Below are the description of the main input sources and the outputs produced in this release.
