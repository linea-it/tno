# Predictions with CA Uncertainties

Release date: September 5th, 2024.

Main updates include dynamic maps in the occultation detail page the introduction of a subscription service.

At this stage occultation predictions are computed for the outer Solar System objects including **Trojans**, **Centaurs**, and **Kuiper Belt** objects,
and now also the **Near-Earth Asteroids**.

The total number of predictions also include a small percentage of events that happen strictly during the day, which are in very special cases of interest to some astronomers.

Below are the description of the main input sources and the outputs produced in this release.
