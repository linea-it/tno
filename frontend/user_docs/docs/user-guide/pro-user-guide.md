## <a name="main_page"></a>Main Page

This is the **LIneA Solar System Occultation Prediction Database Portal** (LIneA OPD). This database features predictions for stellar occultations by small Solar System objects, updated regularly.

At the top left of the page, user may find the folowing options:

- [Home](https://solarsystem.linea.org.br/): Redirects to the LIneA OPD home page.
- [About](https://solarsystem.linea.org.br/about-us): Redirects to a page with information about LIneA and the OPD.
- [Documentation](https://solarsystem.linea.org.br/docs/): Redirects to the documentation page.
- [Contact](https://solarsystem.linea.org.br/contact-us): Redirects to a page with information about LIneA's contact info, social medias and supporters

User may find in the front page three pannels. At the top pannel, three boards presents the total number of predictions and small objects (TOTAL FORECAST), the predictions happening within the next 24h, this week and next week (EVENTS TODAY), and the upcoming occultations in the next month (UPCOMING THIS MONTH).

Below, on the second pannel, user may find a pannel for filtering events. For details in how to use it, please check the [Filter Events Documentation](https://solarsystem.linea.org.br/docs/user-guide/filter-events/) page.

The third pannel contains the prediction maps. For more information, please check the [Occultation Details Documentation](https://solarsystem.linea.org.br/docs/user-guide/occultation-details-page/) page.

At the bottom of the page, there is also important information about LIneA, its contact info, social medias and supporters.

## <a name="create_filter"></a>Create New Filter

After clicking on the '+ new filter' button on the top right of the second pannel, a new page will be opened to create a new email preference for a NEWSLetter. Some of the filters are required -- **Filter Name**, **Frequency**, and **Geo Location (Latitude, Longitude and Radius)** -- while others are optional.

First, choose a name for the filter and its **Frequency** (Daily, Weekly, or Monthly). User may include a short **Description** about the filter (e.g. a specific object or orbital class, the frequency, etc.).

Right below the filter description box, optional filters are available on the **Filter type** dropdown. Here it is possible to select an object name, dynamic class, or dynamic class with subclasses. After choosing it, a new dropdown pannel will appear on the right with the respective options. User can choose a specific object, class or subclass. User can also select more than one object, but only one class or class and subclass.

The following filter is to select star **Magnitude limit**. No occultations will be visible for stars with higher magnitudes (fainter stars). On the right, user may choose a **Magnitude drop**. No occultations will be visible with higher magnitude drop.

On the following filters user may choose the time interval for **events start** and **end**.

It is also possible to limit the occultation alerts for **minimum** and **maximum object diameter**, the **event duration**, or the **uncertainty**.

The lower pannel user may include the Geo Location, with Latitude (North positive, South negative) and Longitude (East positive, West negative) in degrees, the Radius (put 'zero' for a fixed location or the distance, in km, that it is possible to travel for an observation) and altitude.

By clicking on 'MY LOCATION' button, user need to allow the browser to get the position and will automatically include the coordinates. The 'CLEAR LOCATION' button will clear all the Geo location fields.

To cancel the creation of the filter, click on 'DISCARD CHANGES' button.

After setting all filter preferences, click on 'SAVE FILTER' button at the bottom of the page. User will be redirected to the **User Preferences** page.
