# Occultation Detail Page

The occultation details page aggregates information not only about the event but also about the occulted star and the object and also includes a generic map for this occultation prediction.

### Occultation Prediction Circumstances

It organizes specific information and parameters that, in general, are the product of the occultation prediction calculation.

### Occultation Prediction Map

Maps for occultation prediction are not available for all events as they are generated periodically due to the large number of events available. For events where a prediction map does not exist, it is generated on demand when the event prediction details page is loaded. Note that generating the map can take up to a minute.

Maps are generated using the [SORA](https://sora.readthedocs.io/) library. To generate personalized and detailed maps, visit the module documentation. When using the map provided in your publications, check the protocols for adequately citing sources as described in this documentation.

### Occulted Star

Brings information about the hidden star, generally from the Gaia stellar catalog.

### Object

Brings information about the occulting object. The orbital parameters are sourced from the Minor Planet Center. Diameter, when available, is sourced from the [Virtual Observatory Solar system Open Database Network](https://ssp.imcce.fr/webservices/ssodnet/) at IMCCE (when using this information in your publications, please check their protocols for adequately citing the source). We also provide links to further information on the object at SsODNet service at IMCCE and Small-Body Database Lookup at JPL/NASA.
